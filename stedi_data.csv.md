### Introduction

### Background

The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted the global economy, causing inflation and putting a strain on businesses, especially small enterprises. In this context, innovative solutions are needed to stimulate economic activity and promote road safety.

### Problem Statement

Existing Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems and road safety initiatives often fall short in effectively engaging users and fostering economic growth. Stedi addresses these gaps by providing a platform that incentivizes safe driving and supports economic activity.

### Literature Review

### Economic Impact of COVID-19

The pandemic has led to economic downturns globally, with many businesses struggling to survive. Inflation has also increased, making it harder for consumers to afford goods and services.

### Road Safety Incentives

Incentivizing safe driving has been shown to reduce accidents and improve road safety. Existing programs often lack engagement and tangible rewards, limiting their effectiveness.

### Self-Driving Technology in Developing Countries

Self-driving vehicles are often too expensive and technologically advanced for widespread use in developing countries. These regions require cost-effective alternatives that can enhance road safety without significant investment in new technology.

### Stedi: The Concept

In regions with limited resources, Stedi provides advanced driving data tracking without the need for self-driving cars. This technology can significantly enhance road safety in areas where self-driving vehicles are not feasible.

### Ethical Use of Driving Data

Stedi is committed to using driving data ethically to improve road safety and driving habits. The app tracks speed limits and driving patterns, using this information to provide personalized feedback and rewards.

### Enhancing Law Enforcement Efficiency

### Monitoring High-Speed Roads

Stedi will ethically track driving speeds on high-speed roads to ensure compliance with speed limits. This data is privately recorded for safety purposes, helping to maintain safe driving conditions.

### Reducing Police Corruption

By constantly monitoring traffic and speed records, Stedi aims to prevent corruption by police when traffic laws are violated. This ensures that drivers are fairly treated and that laws are enforced consistently.

### Supporting Police Departments

For police departments with limited resources, Stedi provides valuable data that can help manage traffic safety more effectively. This can reduce the burden on traffic cops and improve overall road safety.

### Methodology

### Data Collection

Stedi collects data on driving behavior through GPS tracking. This data is analyzed to determine safe driving habits and award points accordingly.

### Impact Measurement

The app's impact is measured through metrics such as the number of safe driving incidents, points redeemed, and economic activity generated. These metrics help assess the effectiveness of Stedi in promoting road safety and economic growth.

### Discussion

### Challenges and Solutions

Implementing Stedi may face challenges such as user adoption and data privacy concerns. These can be addressed through user education and robust data protection measures.

### Future Prospects

Stedi has the potential to expand its features and impact. Future developments could include partnerships with more businesses and advanced analytics to provide deeper insights into driving behavior.

### Conclusion

Stedi offers a unique solution to the dual challenges of economic downturn and road safety. By rewarding safe driving with discounts on products and services, the app stimulates economic activity and promotes safer roads. Its cost-effective approach makes it particularly beneficial for developing countries, providing a scalable and accessible alternative to self-driving technology. Furthermore, Stedi’s ethical tracking of driving speeds enhances law enforcement efficiency and helps prevent police corruption, ensuring fair and consistent enforcement of traffic laws.
