If you have questions about the specific information we process or retain about you, as well as your choices regarding our data collection and use practices, please contact us using the information provided below.</p>    
            <p>We may disclose your information to third parties in accordance with this Privacy Policy. This includes sharing information with our affiliates or others within our corporate group for internal administration or support purposes, which is in our legitimate interest to operate a successful business and provide our Services. We may also disclose your information to service providers and vendors that assist in delivering the Services, such as those providing system administration, cloud storage, AI content creation, security, customer transaction facilitation, marketing communications, web analytics, payment networks, and payment processing. In addition, we may share information with business partners that facilitate your access to our Services, such as through promotion codes or other partnership arrangements, to provide free or discounted access to the Services.</p>

            <p>If you direct us to disclose your information, for example, through the use of social media widgets, login integrations, or when purchasing third-party goods via the Services, we may share your information with other third parties, including other users. Outputs or shared content that you make publicly available may also be visible to others. Advertising partners may receive your information to assist with delivering advertisements or displaying advertising information on our Services. When necessary, we may share your personal data with professional advisors such as auditors, legal counsel, and accountants to protect our business interests or comply with legal obligations.</p>
            
            <p>In the event of a corporate control change, such as a merger, restructuring, asset sale, bankruptcy, or similar transaction, we may share personal information with a prospective buyer, seller, or new owner to ensure business continuity. Additionally, we may disclose your information as required to comply with applicable law, regulatory obligations, judicial orders, or law enforcement inquiries. Such disclosures also help enforce our terms of service, protect the safety of our business and users, and meet legal and security requirements.</p>

            <p>Certain features of the Services may allow you to initiate interactions between the Services and third-party platforms or services, such as Discord, X (formerly Twitter), and other social networks ("Social Features"). These Social Features may allow you to access our pages on third-party platforms and engage with our content, such as liking or sharing it. When you use these features, a third party may collect and/or use your information. Any content you post or make accessible through these Social Features may be publicly displayed by the third-party service. Both we and the third party may have access to information about you and your use of both the Services and the third-party platform. For further information, please refer to the section below on Third-Party Websites and Links.</p>

            <p>We may provide links to third-party websites or platforms, such as Discord and X (formerly Twitter). If you follow links to sites or platforms that we do not control and are not affiliated with us, you should review their privacy policies, terms of service, and other applicable notices. We are not responsible for the privacy or security of, or any information found on, these third-party sites or platforms. Information you provide on public or semi-public venues, such as third-party social networking platforms, may also be visible to other users of both the Services and those third-party platforms without restriction on its use. Our inclusion of such links does not imply any endorsement of the content on those platforms or of their owners or operators.</p>
        
            <p>Children under the age of 13 are not permitted to use the Services, and we do not knowingly collect or seek to collect any personal information from children, particularly those under 13 years of age, or in regions where the minimum age for processing personal data differs. For users above the age of 13 but below the age at which they can legally consent to the processing of their personal information, we require parental or guardian consent before using the Services.</p>

            <p>If we become aware that we have unknowingly collected information from a child under the relevant minimum age, we will make commercially reasonable efforts to delete such information. If you are the parent or guardian of a child under the applicable age who has provided us with their personal information, please contact us using the information below to request its deletion.</p>

            <p>Despite our reasonable efforts to protect your information, no security measures are completely impenetrable, and we cannot guarantee "perfect security." Any information you send to us electronically, whether through the Services or by other means, may not be secure while in transit. We recommend that you avoid using unsecured channels to send sensitive or confidential information.</p>

            <p>We retain your information for as long as reasonably necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy. When determining how long to retain your information, we consider factors such as whether we need the data to continue providing the Services, resolve disputes, enforce our contractual agreements, prevent harm, promote safety, ensure security and integrity, or protect our rights, property, or products.</p>

            <p>Depending on where you live, you may have certain rights regarding the personal information we have collected about you. These rights are not absolute, and in some instances, we may decline your request as permitted by law. You may have the right to access or request information about the personal data we hold about you, including details about its collection, use, and disclosure. You may also have the right to request that we delete the personal information we maintain about you or correct any inaccuracies. Additionally, you may have the right to receive a copy of your personal information and request that we transfer it to a third party. In certain cases, you may request that we stop, suspend, or restrict our processing of your personal data, or object to our processing altogether.</p>

            <p>If we rely on your consent to process your personal information, you have the right to withdraw this consent at any time by contacting us at support@votalityai.com. Please note that withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing conducted before your withdrawal, but it may prevent us from delivering the Services to you as expected.</p>
            
            <p>You may also opt out of receiving personalized advertising or marketing promotions by contacting us at the provided email address. To exercise any of these rights, please contact us using the information below. We may require additional information, such as your email address or government-issued ID, to verify your identity before responding to your request. You can also designate an authorized agent to act on your behalf by providing a written document or power of attorney. If your request is denied, you may appeal our decision by contacting us again.</p>
            
            <p>To stop the collection of your information for AI purposes, such as improving our models, you can adjust your settings on the Services. You may also request to delete your account through the settings page or by contacting us at support@votalityai.com. Upon deletion, we aim to remove your personal data from our servers within 30 days.</p>

            <p>If you have any complaints about how we process your personal information, please contact us at support@votalityai.com, and we will respond to your request as soon as possible.</p>

<p>If you believe we have violated data protection laws, you can file a complaint with the data protection supervisory authority in your country of residence or work, or where you believe the infringement occurred. This may include filing a complaint with the relevant authority, such as the UK Information Commissioner's Office or another applicable data protection authority.</p>
